---

### **Overview**
The paper introduces **Llama 2**, a family of large language models (LLMs) developed by Meta AI, ranging from **7B to 70B parameters**. It includes both **pretrained foundation models** and **fine-tuned chat models (Llama 2-Chat)** designed for dialogue applications. The goal is to provide **open-source, high-performing alternatives** to closed-source models like GPT, while emphasising **responsible AI development**.

### **Key Contributions**
1. **Model Release**  
   - Three sizes: **7B, 13B, and 70B parameters**.
   - Pretrained on **publicly available datasets** and fine-tuned for safety and helpfulness.
   - Open weights and documentation for research and commercial use.

2. **Fine-Tuning Strategy**
   - **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)**: Uses curated instruction-following datasets.
   - **Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF)**: Aligns models with human preferences.
   - **System prompts** for multi-turn consistency in dialogue.

3. **Safety Enhancements**
   - **Safety fine-tuning** and **red-teaming** to reduce harmful outputs.
   - Evaluation across adversarial prompts and bias tests.
   - Integration of **responsible release strategy** to mitigate misuse.

4. **Performance**
   - Outperforms other open-source chat models on most benchmarks.
   - Competitive with proprietary models in **helpfulness and safety** based on human evaluations.

### **Technical Details**
- **Pretraining**:  
  - Trained on **2 trillion tokens** from diverse sources.
  - Optimised for efficiency using grouped-query attention and RMSNorm.

- **Evaluation**:  
  - Benchmarks include **MMLU**, **TruthfulQA**, and **HumanEval**.
  - Llama 2-Chat shows strong results in reasoning, coding, and factual accuracy.

- **Limitations & Ethics**:  
  - Risks of misuse and bias remain.
  - Paper stresses transparency and community involvement for responsible scaling.
