**Core Idea**  
The paper introduces a simple yet powerful method to enable **autoregressive language models** (like GPT) to perform **Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM)** tasks. Traditionally, these models generate text left-to-right, which limits their ability to insert content in the middle of existing text. The authors propose a **data transformation technique**: move a random span from the middle of a document to the end during training. This trains the model to predict missing spans given both preceding and succeeding context.

### **Key Contributions**
1. **FIM-for-Free Property**  
   Training with up to 50% FIM-transformed data **does not degrade** the modelâ€™s left-to-right generation ability, as measured by perplexity and sampling quality.

2. **Hyperparameter Ablations**  
   The authors explore:
   - Frequency of FIM transformations
   - Span selection strategies
   - Context-level vs document-level FIM  
   They provide **best practices and default settings** for future models.

3. **Pretraining vs Finetuning**  
   Incorporating FIM during **pretraining** is more efficient and effective than adding it later via finetuning.

4. **Benchmarks and API Release**  
   They release:
   - A strong FIM-capable model via API
   - Infilling benchmarks for future research

### **Key Findings**
- FIM improves flexibility for tasks like **code completion**, **document editing**, and **interactive writing**.
- Models trained with FIM maintain competitive performance on standard benchmarks.
- Recommended FIM rate: around **50%** during pretraining for best trade-off.
